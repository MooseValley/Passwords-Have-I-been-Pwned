* Description:  Check if any passwords are on the Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) web site.
* Requirements: Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
                http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html

Step 1. Edit: Passwords__Have_I_Been_Pwned.java
* Scroll down and enter your passwords in the PASSWORDS_ARRAY.
* Examples included below.  Enter your passwords in double quotes and comma separated.
* Save the changes.

Step 2: Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory
where Passwords__Have_I_Been_Pwned.java is saved
and compile and then run.

To compile, enter this command:
   javac Passwords__Have_I_Been_Pwned.java

To run, enter this command:
   java Passwords__Have_I_Been_Pwned

Or, for Windows users, I have included a .BAT command files:

   Passwords__Have_I_Been_Pwned__Compile.bat
   Passwords__Have_I_Been_Pwned__Run_JAR_and_Show_Console_Window.bat

which contains the compile and run commands.
Just double click on them to compile and run the java program.
NOTE: you will need to edit the directory paths in the .BAT file
to suit your Java installation.
